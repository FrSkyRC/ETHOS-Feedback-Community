# Feedback about FrSky Ethos

Thank you for helping FrSky Ethos to be better! Here FrSky could collect input and suggestion from all the end users on the system operation. The goal of this program is to find issues/bugs that can be corrected in further software updates.

Please keep the GitHub section focused on reporting issues/bugs. We will add a priority label on each issue and we may not reply on every issue in the first time but we are sure to take care of them. When the problem is resolved, we ask of you to double check and close the issue. Always check if the issue has already existed on GitHub, in order to prevent 
double posting. Well described bug description is very important for us to try to reproduce it and fix well. 

Thanks a lot for your participation in advance.

Below are some notes to help you report issues/bugs or improvement suggestions. 

### Issue guides
* Please make sure that you have upgraded to latest software version before you post an issue. 
* If you find a new bug, first please look at opened and closed issues to see if the issue is already listed.
* If it does exist you can comment if you have more information. 
* If does not exist, then create a new issue. 

### New issue should contain:
* Firmware version where issue was found, name the topic to describe the bug as the best as possible 
* Description of the issue 
* Description of the expected behavior
* Description how to reproduce the bug
* If possible a screenshot or video, it is worth 1000 words :) 

Thanks again for your interest and help on this new system, we hope it becomes better and better to fulfill all your demands!
